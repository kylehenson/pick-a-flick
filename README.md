#### Have you ever fought over who gets to pick the movie? Or maybe you simply can't make a decision. Well, Pick-a-Flick is here for you. Just add movies to your watchlist - a list for keeping track of movies that you want to watch. You can even create groups to invite your friends or family. Once you are in a group, you can add your movies to the groups watchlist. Then the group gets to vote on the movies and viola - Your movie decision is made.
